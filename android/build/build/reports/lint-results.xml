        id="ObsoleteLintCustomCheck"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.work.lint.WorkManagerIssueRegistry`) which is older than the current API level; these checks may not work correctly.&#xA;&#xA;Recompile the checks against the latest version. Custom check API version is 3 (3.3), current lint API level is 5 (3.5+)"

        priority="10"
        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks."

    <issue
        id="VectorRaster"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Limit vector icons sizes to 200Ã—200 to keep icon drawing fast; see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio#when for more"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="5"
        summary="Vector Image Generation"
        explanation="Vector icons require API 21 or API 24 depending on used features, but when `minSdkVersion` is less than 21 or 24 and Android Gradle plugin 1.4 or higher is used, a vector drawable placed in the `drawable` folder is automatically moved to `drawable-anydpi-v21` or `drawable-anydpi-v24` and bitmap images are generated for different screen resolutions for backwards compatibility.&#xA;&#xA;However, there are some limitations to this raster image generation, and this lint check flags elements and attributes that are not fully supported. You should manually check whether the generated output is acceptable for those older devices."

However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."
