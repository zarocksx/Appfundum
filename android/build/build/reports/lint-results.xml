    <issue
        id="UnusedAttribute"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Attribute `appComponentFactory` is only used in API level 28 and higher (current min is 18)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Attribute unused on older versions"
        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the `minSdkVersion` attribute).&#xA;&#xA;This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags can be unused too, such as the new `&lt;tag>` element in layouts introduced in API 21."

    <issue
        id="VectorRaster"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Limit vector icons sizes to 200Ã—200 to keep icon drawing fast; see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio#when for more"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="5"
        summary="Vector Image Generation"
        explanation="Vector icons require API 21 or API 24 depending on used features, but when `minSdkVersion` is less than 21 or 24 and Android Gradle plugin 1.4 or higher is used, a vector drawable placed in the `drawable` folder is automatically moved to `drawable-anydpi-v21` or `drawable-anydpi-v24` and bitmap images are generated for different screen resolutions for backwards compatibility.&#xA;&#xA;However, there are some limitations to this raster image generation, and this lint check flags elements and attributes that are not fully supported. You should manually check whether the generated output is acceptable for those older devices."

        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."
