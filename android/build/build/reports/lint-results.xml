        id="VectorRaster"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Limit vector icons sizes to 200Ã—200 to keep icon drawing fast; see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio#when for more"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="5"
        summary="Vector Image Generation"
        explanation="Vector icons require API 21 or API 24 depending on used features, but when `minSdkVersion` is less than 21 or 24 and Android Gradle plugin 1.4 or higher is used, a vector drawable placed in the `drawable` folder is automatically moved to `drawable-anydpi-v21` or `drawable-anydpi-v24` and bitmap images are generated for different screen resolutions for backwards compatibility.&#xA;&#xA;However, there are some limitations to this raster image generation, and this lint check flags elements and attributes that are not fully supported. You should manually check whether the generated output is acceptable for those older devices."

        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."
